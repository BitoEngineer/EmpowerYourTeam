Considering the team members description that you gave me before, Luís, Andrej, Nuno, Jorge and Candida, I want the transcript of 5 daily meeeting of that team. 
Consider the following:
- The team is working on a feature to use ChatGPT API to generate automatically fixes for the issues detected by Codcy
- Nuno Cardoso is with personal issues and that's impacting the way that he behaves, ending up being more aggresive and not very collaborative
Please give me the transcripts as a JSON schema that respects the following format:
    public class Meeting
    {
        public Transcript Transcript { get; set; }
        public int DurationMinutes { get; set; }
        public PartOfTheDay PartOfTheDay { get; set; }
    }
    public enum PartOfTheDay
    {
        EarlyMorning,
        BeforeLunch,
        AfterLunch,
        LateAfterNoon
    }
    public class Transcript
    {
        public List<Talk> Talks { get; set; }
    }
    public class Talk
    {
        public string MemberName { get; set; }
        public string Text { get; set; }
        public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
        public TimeSpan Duration { get; set; }
    }
